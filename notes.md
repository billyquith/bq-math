Vector
------

Vector optimisation might be done later using:

- [Vectorial](https://github.com/scoopr/vectorial) - optimised SIMD
- [MathFu](https://github.com/google/mathfu) - optimised SIMD but quirky syntax. Google.
- [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net) - works well for GL/GLSL
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - good performance but designed for linear alegbra
- [Kazmath](https://github.com/Kazade/kazmath) - what Cocos-X uses

Eigen and GLM have good performance. Comparison with Vectorial, MathFu unknown.
